### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) - This article helped me position the footer at the bottom of the page instead of directly below the card component.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.php) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how box-shadows work/are structured.
